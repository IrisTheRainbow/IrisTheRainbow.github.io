<h2>Hello.</h2>
<p>I'm <em class="color-0">Iris</em>, also known as <em>Iris</em>. I'm a 15 year old <em>girl</em> from Sweden, and a big time hobbyist. I've broken things, fixed things, messed with things, and have come to one conclusion: <em>everything is broken</em>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that can be fixed - or so I hope, for the good of everyone.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>
I solve problems <del>by creating new ones to replace them</del>. I've been doing software for a long time, and have developed an obligatory realistic view combined with a vast array of knowledge. Among the things I do are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="color-5">Reverse engineering</strong> - taking apart code in order to figure out inner workings and patch it to do what it <em>should've been designed to do</em>. Corporations hate that. I'm mainly focused on x86/x86-64 architecture code, though.</li>
<li><strong class="color-2">Windows® software development</strong> - and by that I don't mean just 'writing line-of-business desktop software'. I have a large focus on the internals of the NT OS platform and adhering to my interpretation of the original NT principles, executing this through C++ code, C# code or whatever-the-hell might be needed in the future, including knowing the whole chain of troubleshooting tools from COM and RPC to complicated NT system call interaction and custom CLR profiles.</li>
<li><strong class="color-3">Web 'development'</strong> - even though I might not be up-to-date with all the new gadgets the modern ES lovers bang on about or the latest backend ecosystems, I still pack a few tricks - and I can get things done.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I've done</h2>
<p>
Even though I might not have had any professional experience, I've had a whole set of personal 'fun projects' to hang around, some of which ending up pretty popular among certain groups of people online. A friendly selection:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="color-7">alterIWnet</strong> - the one thing everything built off of: a community focused around research and development of modified versions of the Call of Duty® video game series, at its peak having ~10k concurrent players, ~150k unique daily players, a large community management team and spanning across 3 games in the series.</li>
<li><strong class="color-4">fourDeltaOne</strong> - a continuation of alterIWnet, but with more freedom and eschewing the completely silly concept of 'equal access but non-equal skill levels' management (and piracy condoned by the aforementioned) that made the former fail. More games were supported, everything worked <em>even better</em> and innovation was around all of it. After a formal request from Activision, the project was shut down.</li>
<li><strong class="color-6">CitizenFX</strong>/<strong class="color-1">FiveM</strong> - a chain of modification frameworks, taking in the concepts of past third-party multiplayer additions for the Grand Theft Auto® series, however basing itself on an embedded layer in-between the built-in multiplayer frameworks and adding features allowing the community to customize both the single-player and multiplayer experience in an efficient fashion. As with the former project, eventually shut down upon formal request.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, a few lovely side projects I <del>create</del>, track, follow and/or contribute to!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="color-0">ImmersiveHost</strong> - a research project into running Windows 10 'Store' applications with added <em>freedom</em>, given the silliness of the usual deployment system these applications do.</li>
<li><strong class="color-2">KRT</strong> - an unfinished attempt at a GTA3 clone game engine to be worked on cooperatively with parts of the GTA modding community. Abandoned since due to time constraints.</li>
<li><strong class="color-3">GBH2</strong> - a pipe dream GTA2 remake/modernization/sequel. Went through many incarnations, but as all publicly available game engines have glaring <em>flaws</em> I spent most time theorizing a core and being lazy.</li>
<li><strong class="color-7">Ayria</strong> - an experimental project that I've provided code reviews, developmental advice and patches for, that could turn into a gem for genericizing the game modding ecosystem. - <a href="https://github.com/AyriaPublic">GitHub org</a></li>
<li><strong class="color-4">Referential Integrity Labs</strong> - a collective name tied to a few projects and future plans of mine, none of which really public so far.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to get in touch with me</h2>
<p>
You don't.
</p>

<h2>Obligatory non-professional information</h2>
<p>
However much it might seem that I am not, I am still a person, and have a physical presence as well. Here's some fun details.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="color-6">Hobbies</strong> - None explicitly at this time I also like to pretend to know something about <em>everything</em>.</li>
<li><strong class="color-1">Favorite music</strong> - No real defined musical taste, and I <em>used to</em> avoid discovering anything as well.</li>
<li><strong class="color-0">Favorite movie</strong> - I don't have a taste in movies <em>either</em>, and whatever used to be here got misinterpreted, so it is gone now.</li>
<li><strong class="color-5">Favorite TV series</strong> - In no particular order, a few notable ones: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3107288/" title="obligatory mainstream series">The Flash (2014)</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/" title="really, really great">House</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/" title="wonderful piece of art">Mr Robot</a>.</li>
<li><strong class="color-2">Favorite video games</strong> - None, really. Most of them tend to be a waste of time to actually <em>play</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em class="color-3">That's all.</em></p>
